							<p id="intro"><i>DIET</i><br>
							
						

Archaeobotanical, bioarchaeological, zooarchaeological, and archaeological evidence suggests a great deal of diversity in the Maya diet, reflecting environmental 
differences in quantities and types of food resources available, agricultural potential from region to region, as well as logistical aspects of food distribution systems 
(Dunning, 1996; Dunning and Beach, 2004; Fedick, 1996).  Among the botanical taxa recovered from Cop√°n are corn, 
beans, squash, chayote (<i>Sechium edule</i>), bottle gourd (<i>Lagenaria</i> sp.), and two species of palm (<i>Acrocomia mexicana</i> and <i>Bactris</i> sp.)[Lintz, 1991].  <i>A. mexicana</i> is called coyol 
and according to ethnographic studies the Maya eat fresh coyol kernels (Alcorn, 1984) and make a drink from it (Roys, 1931; Tozzer, 1941).  Coyol could have been brought into 
the Cop√°n Valley to take its sap and make wine, once the food supply became diminished as the population grew, they may have eaten coyol, and there have been a lot of ‚Äònutting stones‚Äô 
found in rural areas around Cop√°n thought to have been used to crack coyol (Lentz, 1991, 272).  Coyol has been found in Preclassic settlements at Cerros, Belize (Cliff and Crane, 1989; Crane, 1986),
 at Colh√°, Belize (Caldwell, 1980).  In fact, coyol consumption was so widespread that Dahlin and Litzinger (1986) hypothesize that chultuns were used to ferment coyol into wine.  

Other cultivars Lentz found in his analysis include tree fruits such as ciruela (<i>Spondias</i> sp.), avocado (<i>Persea americana</i>), nance (<i>Brysonima crassifolia</i>), and zapote (<i>Pouteria</i> sp.). 
 Wild foods include wild grapes (Vitis sp.), hackberry (Celitis sp.), and seeds from weedy species include sedge (Scleria sp.), wild grass (Paspalum sp.), and carpetweed (Mollugo verticillata)
 [Lentz, 1991, 277-278].  Although a plant called ramon (Brosimum alicastrum) is commonly found on Maya sites and considered to be an important food source, none was found at Cop√°n (Lentz, 1991, 279). 
 Corn (Zea mays) was abundant in all time periods and in all strata of the community.  Morphologically, the corn from Cop√°n resembles the Mexican variety known as Chapalote-Nal-Tel, which 
 probably originated in the Tehuac√°n Valley dating to the Abejas phase (3000 BC), but was found all over Mesoamerica by the Classic period (Manglesdorf et al., 1967).  

Studies of wetland agricultural fields at the nearby ancient city of Blue Creek demonstrate that a wide variety of crops for food and other purposes were grown 
(Beach, et al., 2010; Bozarth and Guderjan, 2002; Luzzadder-Beach and Beach, 2008). Studies by Bozarth (2009, 2010) show considerable pollen and phytolith evidence for 
cultivation of fruit trees, including breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), craboo or cha (Byrsonima species), caimito, agya, or sebul (Chrysophyllum species), chicle macho, 
chiquibul or chicle (Manilkara species), cacao (Theobroma cacao) or mountain cacao (T. bicolor), and avocado (Persia). At least one species of Marantaceae, probably platanillo 
(Pleiostachya pruinosa) or wild banana (Stromanthe hjalmarssonii) was grown for large leaves used as food wrappers and disposable plates. Additionally, maize (Zea mays) and sweet potato 
(Ipomoea) pollen were found.


The health and diet of Maya populations at the end of the Classic period has long been thought to have been declining with degrading environmental conditions. However, decades of bioarchaeological 
research show ambiguous data vis-√†-vis the quality of health; what is clear is that the Maya region was heterogeneous in regards to diet and the health effects derived from that diet.  
For example, some researchers see a decline in stature in the Late Classic period, whereas some workers see the opposite (see below). Evidence supporting environmental and dietary decline 
include assassinated elites, decapitated and buried in front of the major temple at Colha, Belize, who exhibit dietary stress (Massey and Steele, 1997). Children exhumed at the elite residential 
Las Sepulturas group at Copan show evidence of malnutrition (Storey, 1997), and there was also an increased degree of hypoplasia in children during the Late Classic at a number of sites, though 
the increase was most evident at ‚Äúurban‚Äù rather than ‚Äúrural‚Äù settlements (Danforth, 1997). The ‚Äúrural‚Äù site in this case is Barton Ramie, a site similar to our site at Nojol Nah. 

A major proponent of the concept that diet was not degrading at the end of the Classic period is Lori Wright who argues that much of the supporting evidence comes from increased numbers of 
dental carries which more likely represent a shift in breast feeding and weaning patterns (Wright, 1997a). Also, isotopic evidence from the R√≠o Pas√≠on area do not support increased reliance on
 maize and a decrease of meat consumption during the Terminal Classic period (Wright, 1997b). Finally, in a summary article of the available data, Wright and Christine White argue that neither 
 pathological nor isotopic data consistently support declining quality of diet or increasing burden of disease across the lowlands (Wright and White, 1996). 

Health in Late Classic Cop√°n
Whittington (1989) addresses demography and disease among the lower social classes in Late Classic contexts from Cop√°n ranging from the time of the collapse of centralized political control (AD 810)
 to the abandonment of the city (AD 1200).   Specifically, Whittington looked at the skeletons of 160 low status people to see if differences could be recognized in the levels of disease between 
 segments of the lower classes, and whether disease levels and demography changed through time and if these processes contributed to the decline of Cop√°n. Distribution of pathology within the sample 
 revealed that the lower socioeconomic classes at Cop√°n were indeed unhealthy and highly stressed immediately before and after the fall of the city.  The non-elites inhabiting the core of Cop√°n 
 exhibited higher rates of infections than the people that lived on the periphery of the settlement, but no significant difference was noted between the core and periphery populations in the amounts
 of nutritionally related stress (Whittington, 1989).  The different site types examined did not reveal significant differences in levels of disease or demography, and no significant difference 
 could be detected in the amounts of disease between males and females of the non-elites (Whittington, 1989). 

Marcus (1982) postulates the existence of an outfield-infield system at Cop√°n; this system consisted of outfields (col) where crops such as corn, beans, and squash were grown with Swidden 
agriculture, and an infield (pacal), where doorway gardens were farmed and fruit trees were planted for their food as well as to shade the elite houses.  Lentz (1991) argues that corn was 
the staple for all levels of society at Cop√°n, but the elites had greater access to the infield orchards, and thus a wider range of dietary diversity.  That the elite households yielded a 
higher diversity of plant foods is significant, because as long as a person gets sufficient calories, a more diverse diet tends to increase the chances that the person will consume the necessary 
range of vitamins and nutrients (Lentz, 1991).  Even if the non-elites at the site had enough maize to meet their caloric requirements, a diet based solely on corn would lead to nutritional 
deficiencies, especially if beans are not in sufficient quantity to create the complementary effect of protein in corn and beans if consumed together (Kaplan, 1973).   

Storey (1997) examined the remains of individuals exhumed from a large elite compound at Cop√°n, 9N-8, in the residential barrio of Las Sepulturas, dating from AD 700-1000.  
She specifically looked at the remains of children to address questions such as morbidity rates and evidence of nutritional deficiencies related to socioeconomic class. Storey (1997) found that 
all of the children she analyzed had some nutritionally related defects.  High rates of porotic hyperostosis and perisosteal reactions indicate that malnutrition and/or infections were a common 
cause of death for children at Cop√°n, and most of the children had been ill for a prolonged period prior to their death (Storey, 1997).  Storey also notes that morbidity is a result of 
environmental and cultural factors, and individual risk levels are dependent on constitutional and life experience factors, including the circulation of infectious diseases, stating: 
‚Äúbut as many demographers and public health researchers know, the deaths and survival of children can often be explained by quite definite links of biological characteristics of malnutrition 
and disease with the differential distribution of basic necessities of life, that is, socioeconomic factors‚Äù (Storey, 1997). One important result of Storey‚Äôs work at Cop√°n is that greater
 socioeconomic status did not protect children from malnutrition, infection, and premature death at the settlement, but higher status did help improve health conditions a little.  So many 
 children died at Cop√°n from AD 700-1000 that Storey (1997) describes the center as a ‚Äúsociety on the verge of decline.‚Äù
