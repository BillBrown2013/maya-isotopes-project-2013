						<p id="intro"><i>Plaque and Gum Disease</i><br>
							Microorganisms living in the mouth ensconced in a matrix of protein and saliva form a substance called plaque. 
							Mineralization of plaque solidifies it into tartar, or dental calculus.  Food remains and phytoliths become enmeshed in calculus so analysis of 
							the substance can yield paleo-dietary information (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Roberts and Manchester 1995).  Other microorganisms and bacteria lie at 
							the gum line, and when tartar builds up it opens space for harmful bacteria to invade, leading to an immune response and inflammation of the gums.  
							If untreated this inflammation promotes tooth decay and erodes nearby supporting bone including the roots of the affected dentition, remodeling the bony structural 
							support for the teeth.  In the long term, the height of the alveoli is progressively reduced (known as aveolar resorption) eventually leading to tooth loss 
							(Hillson 2000).  Consumption of sucrose accelerates concentration of mouth-dwelling micro-organisms, increasing plaque buildup. Mineralized plaque takes two forms: 
							subgingival calculus is either black or green in color, found below the gums, and commonly present on tooth roots (Roberts and Manchester 1995). Supragingival calculus 
							is more common than the subgingival form, lying above the gum line and tends to be brown or gray in color (Roberts and Manchester 1995).  Teeth nearest the salivary 
							glands (the lingual aspects of the lower incisors and the buccal side of the upper molars) are the most frequent sites for plaque and calculus accumulation 
							(Roberts and Manchester 1995).<br><br>
					
							As calculus gathers in the voids between the tooth, mandible or maxilla, and the soft tissues, it creates “periodontal pockets” that ultimately leads to gum disease (
							Roberts and Manchester 1995). Periodontal disease is one of the most common dental pathologies among modern populations and is a major cause of tooth loss in people over 
							the age of 40 (Roberts and Manchester 1995). Periodontitis starts with gingivitis in the mandible that spreads to the bone; later, the bone is resorbed, the roots of the 
							tooth are exposed, and the tooth eventually falls out. Although periodontitis is very common today and is commonly diagnosed in archaeological specimens, current thought 
							suggests that the disease is over reported because it is difficult to distinguish the mandible’s natural reaction mechanism for marked attrition from the abnormal 
							periodontal condition (Roberts and Manchester 1995).<br><br>   

							Gum disease was most likely endemic in prehistoric Maya communities, given the carbohydrate-rich diet and lack of professional dentists.  Inflammation of the gums 
							and the presence of bacteria associated with periodontal disease have serious ramifications for human health: bacteria involved in periodontitis spreads toxins 
							through the bloodstream.  These bacteria cause plaque buildup in the arteries,   constricting the flow of blood forcing the heart to pump harder to move blood throughout 
							the body, leading to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and erectile dysfunction (www.perio.org).  Inflammation of the gums causes the liver to produce C-reactive protein 
							(CRP), and elevated levels of CRP are linked with an increase in the risk for heart attack and stroke. But that’s not all; The American Academy of Periodontology 
							(www.perio.org) states that periodontal inflammation is correlated with other systemic chronic inflammatory condition including Alzheimer’s disease, type I and II 
							diabetes, respiratory disease, pancreatic cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and reproductive risks such as preterm births and underweight newborns   (www.webmd.com).<br><br>

							High rates of gum disease in the prehistoric Maya world may have had important paleodemographic implications, because not only does the condition increase the hazard 
							for mortality, but it also could have lowered fertility rates through reducing men’s sex drives and increasing risks during childbirth and compromising the survival of 
							newborns.  Further, periodontal disease is communicable through the transmission of saliva (www.perio.org”), so it is possible that increased population 
							densities associated with urbanization or centralization of population in more nucleated settlements would exacerbate periodontitis and thus a host of several debilitating illnesses.<br><br>   

							<i>Caries and Tooth Decay</i><br>

							Dental caries are eroded dark spots on tooth enamel, and are among the most common and informative dental pathologies seen in bones recovered from archaeological 
							contexts (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Hillson 1986; Roberts and Manchester 1995; White and Folkens 2000); the disease is transmissible, and entails progressive 
							destruction of the dental structure. Carious lesions can occur anywhere on a tooth where there is dental plaque; the plaque serves as the matrix for the decay and for 
							the bacteria that forms on teeth. Caries is a “disease process” entailing progressive tooth decay through decalcification of the enamel or dentine 
							(White and Folkens 2000); it is an infectious disease resulting from the fermentation of sugars (sucrose in particular) by bacteria that live on teeth (Roberts and Manchester 1995).  
							<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> and <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> produce waste products such as lactic acid during the metabolism of carbohydrates and these waste products acidify 
							dental plaque, destroying enamel (Hillson 1979).  Several lines of evidence establish a link between rates of caries, amount of dietary carbohydrates, and <i>S. mutans</i> (e.g., 
							Bibby 1970; Hillson 1979, 1986).<br><br> 

							Sugars, particularly sucrose, have been blamed as the main factor in caries frequencies (Navia 1994; Sheiham 1983), because when the correct balance of sucrose and plaque
							bacteria occurs on a tooth, acids are produced that de-mineralize the teeth and create cavities (Roberts and Manchester 1995, described above). Organic acids are produced
							by concentrations of microorganisms leading to localized demineralization of tooth enamel, leading to carious lesions (Hillson 2000:259).  However, caries are not simply 
							the result of too much sugar in the diet.  Powell (1985) notes that there are several factors that promote the disease, including endogenous (morphology of a person’s 
							dentition), exogenous (diet, oral hygiene), environmental (trace elements in food and water such as fluoride), and pathogenic agents (the bacteria that cause the disease)
							[Powell 1985]. Donta (1992) explains caries formation as the result of the interaction of the bacteria in the host’s mouth, the presence of specific minerals 
							(e.g., fluoride) in the host’s drinking water and environment, the morphology of the host’s teeth, and diet.<br><br>   

							The presence of fluoride in the diet is well known as an inhibitor of carious teeth (Leverett 1982; Mandell 1979); high levels of fluoride in food and water during fetal 
							and post-natal dental development can prohibit caries frequencies in farming societies significantly below expected levels (Molnar and Molnar 1985).  The multi-factor 
							nature of caries is also supported by the study of Woodward and Walker (1994) who did not find, in a sample of 12 year old children from 90 westernized countries, a 
							strong correlation between sugar consumption and frequency of caries.  Further, since the disease process of caries is progressive, older people tend to display higher 
							frequencies of tooth decay, so when comparing caries rates of differing populations or skeletal series, the average ages of the samples need to be considered 
							(Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994).<br><br>

							The link between caries and agriculture is less direct than that seen in other lines of evidence such as coprolite and stable isotope analyses, yet in various 
							archaeological settings, increased rates of caries are associated with the rise of agriculture (Cohen and Armelgos 1984; Hillson 1985; Larsen 1983).  Carbohydrate and 
							sucrose-rich maize and grains, staples in many farming societies, promote tooth decay because their sticky consistency causes them to adhere to the surfaces of teeth 
							longer than proteins or fats, providing a food source for the oral bacteria to live on.  Also, proteins and fats reduce the acidity of plaque (i.e., turns plaque more 
							basic), so consumption of starches typical of agricultural diets is thought to have led to global increases in caries frequencies (Donta 1992).  In general, diets rich 
							in coarse materials improve natural cleaning and lower the frequencies of tooth decay (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994), so the common practice in the pre-Columbian Americas 
							of grinding and processing corn exacerbates tooth decay by creating more surface area on the maize for chemical reactions to occur, by increasing the stickiness of the 
							maize, and by reducing the coarseness of the food and decreasing its natural ability to clean.  In farming communities that ground corn with manos and metates, stone 
							grit as a byproduct of the processing provided a further source of mechanical erosion of prehistoric teeth.<br><br>  

							Early anthropologists predicted that caries and economic life-ways are connected, starting in 1870 with Mummery, followed by Hellman (1925), Fisher et al. (1931), 
							Klatsky and Klatell (1943), Clement (1958), prominently prehistoric Britain (Moore and Corbett 1973), El-Najjar (1974), Swanson (1976), Ryan (1977), 
							Cohen and Armelagos (1984), Larsen’s (1983) study of the prehistoric populations along the Georgia coast, the Ohio River Valley (Perzigian et al. 1984), 
							in prehistoric Denmark (Meiklejohn et al. 1984), Berry (1985), Olive (1989), Larsen et al. (1991), Martin et al. (1991), Donta (1992), and Turner (1998), 
							to name just a few.  In 1925 Leigh examined caries in archaeological samples from the primarily hunting and gathering Sioux of the northern Plains and those 
							from Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, and found that while the Siouan sample had almost no caries, the Zunis had a very high rate of 75% carious teeth.<br><br>

							The studies mentioned above consistently show that foraging groups are characterized by low rates of carious teeth, groups with mixed economies engaging in variable 
							combinations of hunting, gathering, and farming tend to have intermediate numbers of caries, and agricultural communities have not only the highest rates of caries 
							but also the highest numbers of people with the condition (Adler and Turner 2000; Cucina and Iscan 1998; Fisher 1978; Herrala 1961; Jurmain 1990; Larsen 1983; Larsen 
							et al. 1991; Walker and Erlandson 1986).  Turner’s (1979) work concluded that the average percent of carious teeth is roughly the same across groups engaging in similar subsistence regimes, but that differences in rates of caries in agricultural communities varies depending on how much of their economy was farming-based and how much of their food came from other sources such as hunting and gathering.  Further, Turner successfully assigned subsistence strategies for bioarchaeological series based on the amounts of caries, finding that in foraging societies, the amount of carious teeth range from 0 to 5.3%, mixed economy groups range from 0.4 and 10.3% carious teeth, while farming communities range from 2.1 to 26.9% (Turner 1979)</p>
